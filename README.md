# Floyd-Warshall-algorithm
---This project is created in order to complete phase 1 of the CPCS-324 final project---<br/>
The program uses Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find all-pairs shortest-paths in a connected weighted graph<br/>
i.e. the shortest path from any vertex to all other vertices<br/>
The graph representation used is an nxn weighted matrix, where n is the number of vertices in the graph<br/>
The attached program uses two display methods exclusively; a simple GUI and the console. The GUI is made especially to represent a specific problem as it contains an image of the graph we wish to solve, so there are two images need to be included while running the program in this case aslong with the .form file; the icon image and the graph image. However, any nxn matrix of any other graph problem can be solved on the console output.
